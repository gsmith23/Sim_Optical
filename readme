Developed from the Geant4 OpNovice example, these programs are being used
to simulate WATCHMAN optics including but not limited to the reflective 
material Tyvek. Tyvek will be used in the Outer Detector which is used as 
a cosmics veto.

These programs were make using Geant4 10.4
For later versions of Geant4 check the
